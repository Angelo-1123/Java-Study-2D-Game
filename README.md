# Java-Study-2D-Game
This is a 2D Treasure Hunt Game made using java by following the first part of RyiSnow's tutorial on Youtube.

This project was conceived as a study.

Assets used come from:
- the drive linked in RyiSnow's Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq&pp=iAQB)
- RPG Maker VX Ace (only the player model, used in order to implement a 3 step walking animation instead of the two step one detailed in the abovelinked tutorial)
